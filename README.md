# sodo
This is not a Sudoku solver.
It does however help you to solve it by :
1. Filtering out numbers that are known in the same row/column/square
2. Filling in known numbers that can't be anything else.

It does have the effect however of semi-solving almost all easy and medium puzzles as soon as one fills in the known 
squartes, excepting only some hard and very hard ones for you to complete (somehow!).
